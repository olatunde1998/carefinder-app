# AltSchool Frontend Capstone Project

Hello, 👋 \
Carefinder allows users to search for hospitals within their region. Users can input their location or select from a list of nearby cities to find hospitals in their area. The platform will provide a list of hospitals and their respective contact details, including address, phone number, and email.
```
Here's some notes about my submission:

1. A link to the project repository  https://github.com/olatunde1998/carefinder-app

2. A publicly live hosted URL of the challenge https://carefinder-app.vercel.app/ 

Thank you very much AltSchool Africa.
Best regards
Rasheed Olatunde
